# Cookie Policy (Session Authentication)

This document describes how iStampit uses browser cookies for user authentication between the public site (`istampit.io`) and the application (`app.istampit.io`).

## 1. Cookie Purpose

We issue a single session cookie after a successful login via the auth service (`app.istampit.io`). This cookie authenticates subsequent requests to protected application APIs.

## 2. Scope & Domain

The session cookie is scoped to the `app.istampit.io` subdomain (host-only) to apply the principle of least privilege. Public, unauthenticated pages at `istampit.io` do not need direct access to this cookie.

## 3. Lifetime

The session cookie lifetime is short-lived (rolling) to reduce risk if intercepted. Idle sessions eventually expire server-side; renewed activity may refresh expiration (sliding window). Exact TTL values may evolve; see CHANGELOG for adjustments.

## 4. Security Attributes

- HttpOnly: Prevents JavaScript access, mitigating XSS token theft.
- Secure: Sent only over HTTPS.
- SameSite=Lax: Allows top-level navigations (e.g., user clicking a link or submitting a form) while blocking most cross-site CSRF vectors.
- Path=/ : Enables all application routes.

## 5. SameSite Rationale

`SameSite=Lax` is chosen because:

- It supports typical navigation flows from `istampit.io` (marketing site) to `app.istampit.io` (app) without degrading UX.
- It provides stronger CSRF mitigation than `None`.

If future embedded contexts (iframes, thirdâ€‘party initiations) require cross-site POSTs, we may switch to `SameSite=None; Secure` accompanied by explicit CSRF tokens and Origin/Referer validation.

## 6. Cross-Domain Considerations

Although `istampit.io` and `app.istampit.io` share a registrable eTLD+1, the cookie set on `app.istampit.io` (host-only) is not automatically sent with requests to `istampit.io`, reducing exposure. Public site components that need authenticated data should proxy via server-side endpoints at `app.istampit.io` rather than reading cookies directly in the browser.

## 7. Recommended Validation Checklist (Pre-Public Launch)

Run in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari (Desktop + iOS):

1. Login and capture `Set-Cookie` header: confirm `HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax` attributes present.
2. Perform a top-level navigation from `istampit.io` to a protected `app.istampit.io` route: cookie is sent.
3. Open a new tab and request an authenticated API endpoint: cookie is sent.
4. Perform cross-site fetch from a third-party origin (if applicable): cookie not sent (expected).
5. Let session idle past TTL: cookie becomes invalid server-side; refresh prompts re-auth.
6. Test logout: cookie invalidated (server) and no further authenticated access.

## 8. Future Enhancements

- Add CSRF double-submit token or SameSite=None upgrade if embedding flows emerge.
- Introduce device/session management UI (list + revoke).
- Add short-lived access token + refresh token rotation strategy if scaling beyond current model.
