# Security Notes (Moved)

Moved to `docs/SECURITY_NOTES.md`. See that file for current vulnerability status, mitigations, and remediation plan.

This minimal stub is retained to preserve historical deep links.

## Residual Risk Assessment

- Remaining advisories limited to dormant code paths or dev-tooling; risk accepted temporarily with clear remediation timeline (<= v1.1).
- Continuous monitoring via Dependabot and CI gate (to be added) reduces window of exposure.

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Complete @lhci/cli upgrade & re-run build/tests.
2. Open tracking issue (SEC-OT-001) in repo (placeholder added to PROJECT_STATUS once issue number exists).
3. Prototype receipt parser (spike) â€“ measure LOC & complexity.
